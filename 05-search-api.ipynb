Each of the 120 texts in the volume is accompanied by a scholarly note that provides detailed background information, while an introductory essay sets the broader historical stage. Approximately one third of the texts are oral in origin, and few have previously been available in book form. \\n',\n",

The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language.

NOTES ON CONTRIBUTORS: Margery Perham (1895-1982) went to Africa to study race relations on a Rhodes Fellowship.\\xa0\\xa0Her sojourn in Africa made her an expert on tribal institutions and a passionate and lifelong supporter of the rights of native peoples, in her writings and as director of the Institute of Colonial Studies. Vera Brittain (1893-1970) served as a nurse during World War I, the conflict in which her fiancée, her beloved brother, and all his friends were killed.\\xa0\\xa0Later Brittain became a committed feminist and wrote extensively about the psychological costs of war.\\xa0\\xa0 Testament of Youth   is a moving and influential account of the slaughter of 1914-18. Angelica Garnett (1918-\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0) is the daughter of artist Vanessa Bell (Virginia Woolf\\'s sister) and Bell\\'s artist lover Duncan Grant.\\xa0\\xa0Garnett\\'s memoir depicts the sophisticated, permissive, and intellectual world of the Bloomsbury circle in which she was raised, and chronicles her quest to come to terms with her extraordinary family and to pursue her own artistic career. Isak Dinesen Baroness Blixen (1885-1962) was born in Denmark and followed her husband to a coffee plantation in Kenya, where she fell in love with Africa and African people.\\xa0\\xa0She became a writer, twice nominated for the Nobel Prize, and is best known for her classic memoir  Out of Africa  . Elspeth Huxley (1907-\\xa0\\xa0 ) was born in London and raised in Kenya on her parents\\' coffee plantation, developing a lifelong love of Africa.\\xa0\\xa0She wrote three memoirs, including  The Flame Trees of Thika  , and was awarded the C.B.E. in 1960 for her extensive commentary on African history and politics. Mary Benson (1919-\\xa0\\xa0 ) was born to an affluent white family in Pretoria. She became a committed opponent of apartheid and testified against it before the United Nations.\\xa0\\xa0After being arrested and exiled from South Africa, she wrote plays and novels about apartheid and a biography of Mandela. Ruth First (1925-1982) was a journalist in Johannesburg who, at age 21, exposed brutal conditions among miners and farm laborers.\\xa0\\xa0Married to the leader of the South African Communist party, First edited a reform journal.\\xa0\\xa0She was arrested and detained in solitary confinement for four months of psychological terror and interrogation.\\xa0\\xa0She was later killed by a letter bomb while living in exile. Emma Mashinini (1929-\\xa0\\xa0 ) was born to a black family in Johannesburg.\\xa0\\xa0After leaving an abusive husband, Mashinini worked in a factory where she began her career as a labor organizer.\\xa0\\xa0She led labor protests through the 1960s and 70s, and was eventually put in prison for six months, where she survived constant interrogation and intimidation. Shudha Mazumdar (1899-\\xa0\\xa0) was born in Calcutta and married at 12 to a Civil Service magistrate. In her travels around India, Mazumdar became interested in women\\'s welfare, and the needs of prostitutes and women prisoners.\\xa0\\xa0She organized and worked for many women\\'s groups, and after her husband\\'s death, felt free to support Gandhi and the nationalist movement as well, though women\\'s welfare remained the focus of her life\\'s work.

Each of the 120 texts in the volume is accompanied by a scholarly note that provides detailed background information, while an introductory essay sets the broader historical stage. Approximately one third of the texts are oral in origin, and few have previously been available in book form. \\n',\n",

The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language.

NOTES ON CONTRIBUTORS: Margery Perham (1895-1982) went to Africa to study race relations on a Rhodes Fellowship.\\xa0\\xa0Her sojourn in Africa made her an expert on tribal institutions and a passionate and lifelong supporter of the rights of native peoples, in her writings and as director of the Institute of Colonial Studies. Vera Brittain (1893-1970) served as a nurse during World War I, the conflict in which her fiancée, her beloved brother, and all his friends were killed.\\xa0\\xa0Later Brittain became a committed feminist and wrote extensively about the psychological costs of war.\\xa0\\xa0 Testament of Youth   is a moving and influential account of the slaughter of 1914-18. Angelica Garnett (1918-\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0) is the daughter of artist Vanessa Bell (Virginia Woolf\\'s sister) and Bell\\'s artist lover Duncan Grant.\\xa0\\xa0Garnett\\'s memoir depicts the sophisticated, permissive, and intellectual world of the Bloomsbury circle in which she was raised, and chronicles her quest to come to terms with her extraordinary family and to pursue her own artistic career. Isak Dinesen Baroness Blixen (1885-1962) was born in Denmark and followed her husband to a coffee plantation in Kenya, where she fell in love with Africa and African people.\\xa0\\xa0She became a writer, twice nominated for the Nobel Prize, and is best known for her classic memoir  Out of Africa  . Elspeth Huxley (1907-\\xa0\\xa0 ) was born in London and raised in Kenya on her parents\\' coffee plantation, developing a lifelong love of Africa.\\xa0\\xa0She wrote three memoirs, including  The Flame Trees of Thika  , and was awarded the C.B.E. in 1960 for her extensive commentary on African history and politics. Mary Benson (1919-\\xa0\\xa0 ) was born to an affluent white family in Pretoria. She became a committed opponent of apartheid and testified against it before the United Nations.\\xa0\\xa0After being arrested and exiled from South Africa, she wrote plays and novels about apartheid and a biography of Mandela. Ruth First (1925-1982) was a journalist in Johannesburg who, at age 21, exposed brutal conditions among miners and farm laborers.\\xa0\\xa0Married to the leader of the South African Communist party, First edited a reform journal.\\xa0\\xa0She was arrested and detained in solitary confinement for four months of psychological terror and interrogation.\\xa0\\xa0She was later killed by a letter bomb while living in exile. Emma Mashinini (1929-\\xa0\\xa0 ) was born to a black family in Johannesburg.\\xa0\\xa0After leaving an abusive husband, Mashinini worked in a factory where she began her career as a labor organizer.\\xa0\\xa0She led labor protests through the 1960s and 70s, and was eventually put in prison for six months, where she survived constant interrogation and intimidation. Shudha Mazumdar (1899-\\xa0\\xa0) was born in Calcutta and married at 12 to a Civil Service magistrate. In her travels around India, Mazumdar became interested in women\\'s welfare, and the needs of prostitutes and women prisoners.\\xa0\\xa0She organized and worked for many women\\'s groups, and after her husband\\'s death, felt free to support Gandhi and the nationalist movement as well, though women\\'s welfare remained the focus of her life\\'s work. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (1900-\\xa0\\xa0 ) was Nehru\\'s sister and the aunt of Indira Gandhi.\\xa0\\xa0She was jailed many times for her active opposition to British rule.\\xa0\\xa0After independence, Pandit served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, the U.S., and Britain, and led the Indian delegation to the United Nations, where she served as President of the U.N.
