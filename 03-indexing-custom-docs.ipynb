    "# Indexing custom documents  \n",
    "\n",
    "Solrâ€™s basic unit of information is a `document`, which is a set of data that describes something. A document about a book could contain the title, author, year of publication, number of pages, and so on. Documents are composed of `fields`, which are more specific pieces of information. Fields can contain different kinds of data. A title field, for example, is text and publication year could be a date or an integer. **If fields are defined correctly, Solr will be able to interpret them correctly**. `Field analysis` tells Solr what to do with incoming data when building an index.\n",
