# Experimenting Search Operations with Solr and Elasticsearch  

From official definitions:  

- [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fine‑tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

The question is, between the two, which one is best suitable for search operations which can be embended into a website and other applications? Answering this question requires clear and extensive understanding of how both platform operate. Let's take a look into both:
