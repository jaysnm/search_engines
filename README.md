# Experimenting Search Operations with Solr, ElasticSearch and MeiliSearch

From official definitions:  

- [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.
- [MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch) is a powerful, fast, open-source, easy to use and deploy search engine. Both searching and indexing are highly customizable. Features such as typo-tolerance, filters, and synonyms are provided out-of-the-box.

The question is, between the three, which one is best suitable for search operations which can be embended into a website and other applications? Answering this question requires clear and extensive understanding of how both platform operate. Let's take a look into both:
